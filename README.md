# Classifier Thresholding
Adaptive Prediction Thresholding for Classifiers in Deployment (APTCID)

**We propose a post-training probability threshold recalibration procedure for probabilistic binary or multi-label classifier algorithms in deployment: Adaptive Prediction Thresholding for Classifiers in Deployment (APTCID).  APTCID serves several purposes: it mitigates the burden of updating the model, it maintains clinically relevant evaluation metrics, and it provides the opportunity to automatically update prediction thresholds and monitors changes in performance.**
